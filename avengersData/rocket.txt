Why are we doing this again?
I get that, but why are we doing it?
We’ll take his ship.
Ever since you got your little sap, you’re a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I’m gonna smash that thing to pieces!
Looks like we’re not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.
Who are you kidding, Quill? You’re one sandwich away from fat.
You know you can’t eat dumbbells, right?
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
Nidavellir is real?Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.
You’re very perceptive.
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a second, it’s me! Yeah, I’ll go.
Quill, sit down.
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.
You know, Quill, you shouldn’t talk that way to your captain. Come on, Groot. Put that game down. You’ll rot your brain.
Tinkle in the cup. We’re not looking. What’s there to see? What’s a twig? Everybody’s seen a twig.
You speak Groot?
Okay, time to be the captain.So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.
And you said your sister and your dad?
Still got a mom, though?
A best friend?
Are you sure you’re up to this particular murder mission?
Yeah, but this Thanos we’re talking about…He’s the toughest there is.
Better be some hammer.
And what if you’re wrong?
I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack… You’re gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.
What’s it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would’ve washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my…Hey, we’re here!
I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning…Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space…
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
Look anything like that?
Go back to the pod.
This is plan? We’re gonna hit him with a brick?
That’s a bit much.
I don’t think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic.You wanna get thm moving…You’re gonna need something a lot bigger to yank ’em loose.
Leave that to you? Buddy, you’re in space. All you got is a rope and a-
“*Dang* it.”? What’s “*dang* it?
Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? I think he’s dying.
… Yeah, he has!
Well, it’d better be some hammer.
No…. No. No. No. No! Groot… no.
