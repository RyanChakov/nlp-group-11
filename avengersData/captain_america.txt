Where’d he go? Thor… where’d he go?
Let’s get you on the jet.
I am Steve Rogers.
Seems like I’m always thanking you for something. 
How we looking?
How you been, Buck?
Wanda, as soon as the stone’s out of his head…you blow it to hell.
That’s not gonna happen.
Them we better keep ’em in front of us.
I’m not looking for forgiveness. And I’m way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we’re here to fight. And if you wanna stand in our way… We’ll fight you, too.
But it should. We don’t trade lives, Vision.
